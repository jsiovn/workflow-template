## What This Repo Is

This is a **template/scaffold repo**, not a deployed application. It produces and updates workflow files _in other (downstream) repos_. There is no build, no test suite, and no runtime service here — the "output" is files copied into downstream checkouts by the `agent-workflow-beads` CLI (`bin/cli.js` → `lib/`), which this repo publishes to npm as the `agent-workflow-beads` package.

Concretely: editing a file under `skills/`, `agents/`, or `templates/` only takes effect after running `agent-workflow-beads update` (or `agent-workflow-beads bootstrap` for a fresh repo) against a downstream repo and committing the refreshed files there. Nothing in this repo runs on its own.

## Mental Model: How Changes Propagate

Three surfaces get written into every downstream repo:

1. **Shared workflow skills** — one source in `skills/<name>/`, always copied into `<downstream>/.claude/skills/<name>/`, and into `<downstream>/.codex/skills/<name>/` only when Codex is enabled (`--with-codex` on `agent-workflow-beads bootstrap` / `update`, or auto-detected when the downstream already has a `.codex/` directory).
2. **Shared agents** — one source in `agents/<name>.md`, always copied into `<downstream>/.claude/agents/<name>.md`, and into `<downstream>/.codex/agents/<name>.md` only when Codex is enabled (`--with-codex`, or auto-detected `.codex/`). Provider-specific overrides can be placed in `templates/.claude/agents/` or `templates/.codex/agents/` and are applied on top.
3. **Bootstrap-only / stage-1 skills** — sources in `templates/skills/<name>/`, always copied into `<downstream>/.claude/skills/<name>/`, and into `<downstream>/.codex/skills/<name>/` only when Codex is enabled (`--with-codex`, or auto-detected `.codex/`). The generic stage-1 `build-and-test` skill lives here and is the one file `agent-workflow-beads update` _preserves_ in the downstream if it already exists (downstream specialization). `attach-web-screenshots` also lives here but is opt-in — only installed when `agent-workflow-beads bootstrap` / `update` is invoked with `--with-screenshots`, or when the skill already exists in the downstream.
4. **Repo-root scaffolding** — `templates/BEADS_WORKFLOW.md`, `templates/PRIME.md`, `templates/.beads/*` (the downstream's `.beads/.gitignore` ships in the package as `templates/.beads/beads.gitignore` — npm refuses to pack a file basenamed `.gitignore` — and `lib/scaffold.js` writes it to the dotted name), and the managed snippets `templates/CLAUDE.snippet.md` (always merged into the downstream's `CLAUDE.md`) and `templates/AGENTS.snippet.md` (merged into the downstream's `AGENTS.md` only when Codex is enabled, or when an `AGENTS.md` already exists) — each injected between `<!-- BEGIN/END TEMPLATE BD WORKFLOW -->` markers by `lib/manageInstructions.js`. The template's own `scripts/` folder no longer exists — the scaffold logic is pure Node in `lib/`, run from the globally-installed CLI. The scaffold still actively removes helper scripts that _older_ template versions shipped into downstreams (e.g. `scripts/shared/manage_instructions.py`) and prunes now-empty template script dirs there. (A downstream may keep its own `scripts/`; the template never touches those.)

`lib/scaffold.js` is the authority on exactly what gets copied and what gets deleted (e.g. removed legacy skills like `plan-debate`, `start-epic-worktree`, `swarm-epic`, `executor-once` via its `LEGACY_SKILLS` list, and stale downstream helper scripts via `LEGACY_SCRIPT_PATHS`). Read it before adding or renaming anything that ships downstream.

### Downstream Git tracks the workflow surface

The scaffolded workflow files (`CLAUDE.md`, `BEADS_WORKFLOW.md`, `.claude/`, and — only when Codex is enabled — `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/`) are **committed to each downstream repo's own git**, so they travel with feature branches and `git worktree` checkouts (the worktree executor flows depend on the skills and agents being present in a fresh checkout). The downstream's `.gitignore` managed block — written by `lib/manageGitignore.js` between the `# BEGIN/END TEMPLATE AGENT WORKFLOW LOCAL-ONLY` markers — lists the machine-local runtime artifacts (`.beads-credential-key`, `.beads/interactions.jsonl`, `.bv/`, `.dolt/`, `*.db`) **plus `docs/plans/`**. Plans are deliberately the one exception: the planner/executor writes them per bead as local scratch, so they are git-ignored — not committed and not pushed (a worktree executor session writes its plan fresh inside the worktree, so the flow does not depend on the plan traveling). Any change you make here propagates in one round-trip: edit here → publish (or `npm link`) the CLI → `agent-workflow-beads update` in the downstream → commit the refreshed files there. (There is no longer a sibling backup-mirror repo; that machinery has been retired.)

## Primary Entry Points

All user-facing operations go through one cross-platform CLI (`bin/cli.js` → `lib/cli.js`), published to npm as `agent-workflow-beads` and installed globally as the `agent-workflow-beads` command. There are no longer POSIX/PowerShell script twins — the scaffold logic is a single Node implementation in `lib/`.

| Purpose                         | Command                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| New downstream repo             | `agent-workflow-beads bootstrap [--with-screenshots] [--with-codex] <repo> <prefix>` |
| Refresh shared workflow surface | `agent-workflow-beads update [--with-screenshots] [--with-codex] <repo>`             |
| Prereq check                    | `agent-workflow-beads check [--with-codex]`                                          |

Claude Code is the **primary** AI in every downstream repo — the `.claude/` surface is always scaffolded. Codex is **opt-in**: the `.codex/` surface and `AGENTS.md` are only scaffolded with `--with-codex`, or auto-detected when the downstream already has a `.codex/` directory.

`bootstrap` (in `lib/commands/bootstrap.js`) delegates to `lib/scaffold.js` + `lib/ensureStage1Beads.js` (which creates the standalone stage-2 follow-up bead to specialize `build-and-test`, plus a matching bead for `attach-web-screenshots` only when that opt-in skill is installed). It runs `bd setup claude` always, plus `bd setup codex` only with `--with-codex`. `update` (in `lib/commands/update.js`) re-runs scaffold on an existing repo. Both accept `--with-screenshots` to install the `attach-web-screenshots` skill and its companion `cleanup-screenshots.yml` CI workflow, and `--with-codex` to scaffold the opt-in Codex surface.

### Local development (this machine)

The CLI resolves its bundled assets relative to its own location (`lib/paths.js`: `ASSET_ROOT = path.resolve(__dirname, '..')`), so it works regardless of cwd. To run in-progress changes against a downstream without publishing, `npm link` from this checkout (puts the `agent-workflow-beads` bin on `PATH` pointing at the working tree), then use `agent-workflow-beads bootstrap <repo> <prefix>` / `agent-workflow-beads update <repo>` as normal.

## Two-Stage Adoption

- **Stage 1** (bootstrap) — generic `build-and-test` that executes each plan's literal `## Verification` section. `lib/ensureStage1Beads.js` creates standalone stage-2 follow-up beads exactly once so they survive re-runs.
- **Stage 2** (specialization, done in the downstream) — specialize the downstream's `build-and-test` skill and add repo-specific docs. `agent-workflow-beads update` preserves the downstream's customized `build-and-test`.

## Managed Snippet Invariants

`CLAUDE.snippet.md` is always injected into the downstream `CLAUDE.md`; `AGENTS.snippet.md` is injected into the downstream `AGENTS.md` only when Codex is enabled (or an `AGENTS.md` already exists). Each is injected between `<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE BD WORKFLOW -->` and `<!-- END TEMPLATE BD WORKFLOW -->`. `lib/manageInstructions.js` replaces only the block between those markers — **do not remove or rename the markers** or it will append a duplicate block on the next `agent-workflow-beads update`. That module also carries verbatim `LEGACY_BLOCKS`/`LEGACY_SNIPPETS` definitions that scrub blocks from older template versions; keep them byte-exact.

## Verifying Changes

When adding or editing a skill, follow `docs/AUTHORING-SKILLS.md` — it covers the SKILL.md conventions, the subagent pressure-test, and the propagation checks before the round-trip below.

There is no test suite. To verify a change:

1. `npm link` from this checkout, then run the relevant command (`agent-workflow-beads bootstrap` or `agent-workflow-beads update`) against a scratch downstream repo.
2. Inspect what landed in the downstream (especially `.claude/skills/`, the `CLAUDE.md` managed block, and — when Codex is enabled — `.codex/skills/` and the `AGENTS.md` managed block; the `.gitignore` managed block should list the runtime artifacts plus `docs/plans/`, not the skill/agent paths).
3. Confirm the refreshed workflow files (skills, agents) show up as ordinary tracked files in `git status` — they are committed, not gitignored. `docs/plans/` is the exception: it stays git-ignored.
4. If the change touches a shared skill, also verify the `.claude/` copy is correct (and, when Codex is enabled, that the `.codex/` copy stayed identical to it).
5. If the change touches packaging or a shipped data path, run `npm pack --dry-run` and confirm the file list includes every asset the scaffold reads (and excludes `scripts/`, repo-only docs, and any file basenamed `.gitignore`).

Because the workflow surface is committed to the downstream's own git, a fresh clone already carries it; run `agent-workflow-beads update` against the clone to pull the latest template versions.

## Conventions

- The scaffold logic is pure Node in `lib/` with **zero runtime dependencies** (only `node:fs/path/child_process/os`) — there are no POSIX/PowerShell twins to keep in sync, and no Python. External tools `git`, `bd`, `dolt` are invoked via `lib/proc.js` (`spawnSync`, `shell:false`, full path resolved through `lib/which.js` so Windows `.cmd`/`.exe` resolve).
- The three Node ports (`lib/manageInstructions.js`, `lib/manageGitignore.js`, `lib/ensureStage1Beads.js`) must stay byte-for-byte faithful to the managed-block / gitignore / bead-title semantics — a one-byte drift breaks idempotency on already-scaffolded downstreams.
- `package.json`'s `files` allowlist governs what ships in the npm package. New shipped data must live under an allowlisted dir (`bin/ lib/ skills/ agents/ templates/`) or be added to the list; verify with `npm pack --dry-run`. Never ship a file basenamed `.gitignore` (npm drops it) — store it under a non-dot name and map it on copy, as done for `templates/.beads/beads.gitignore`.
- `.beads/` is git-ignored here as well — this template repo is not itself managed by `bd`.
- Beads is local-only: never add workflow to publish or sync live `.beads/` state across clones.
- When removing a skill from the template, also add its name to the `LEGACY_SKILLS` list in `lib/scaffold.js` so existing downstreams get it deleted on their next `agent-workflow-beads update` — the copy loop only iterates skills that still exist in the template, so a deleted source is never cleaned up otherwise.
- When adding a new skill under `skills/`, `lib/scaffold.js` picks it up automatically (it iterates every dir in `skills/`) and copies it into `.claude/skills/` always, and into `.codex/skills/` only when Codex is enabled. No `.gitignore` bookkeeping is needed: the workflow surface is committed downstream, and `lib/manageGitignore.js` ignores only machine-local runtime artifacts plus the per-session plan files under `docs/plans/`.

When creating a PR, always set:

- **Assignee:** `jsiovn` (repo owner)
- **Reviewer:** `phudev95` (the repo's other collaborator)
- **Labels:** one type label from the repo's label set — `enhancement`, `bug`, or `documentation` (these are the GitHub defaults; there is no `refactor` or epic-name label, so don't invent one — create the label first if you need it)

```bash
gh pr create \
  --assignee jsiovn \
  --reviewer phudev95 \
  --label "enhancement" \
  ...
