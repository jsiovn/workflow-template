# Review Epic

Run a final quality gate for an epic after implementation is complete.

## Goal

Catch integration, regression, and quality issues that bead-level verification can miss.

## Steps

1. Confirm the target epic and inspect it:
   ```bash
   bd show <epic-id> --json
   ```
2. Review the epic goal, closed child beads, open follow-up beads, and changed files or commits for the branch.
3. Run the final repo-local `build-and-test` workflow if it has not already been run for the whole epic in the current session.
4. Review the epic as a whole:
   - correctness against the epic goal
   - integration between child beads
   - regression risk
   - missing tests or missing verification evidence
   - architectural drift or scope creep
5. Classify findings:
   - `P1`: blocking defect, regression, safety issue, or missing must-have requirement
   - `P2`: important issue that should become follow-up work before broad rollout
   - `P3`: minor cleanup or nice-to-have improvement
6. Act on findings:
   - `P1`: do not close the epic; create or reopen beads and stop
   - `P2`: create follow-up beads and decide whether the epic can still proceed to PR
   - `P3`: note them or create backlog beads if they are worth tracking
7. If the epic is ready:
   - state that the epic passed review
   - summarize any non-blocking follow-up beads
   - proceed to `finishing-a-development-branch`

## Output Format

Present findings first, ordered by severity. Include file references when the finding is tied to a concrete location. Keep the change summary brief and secondary.

## Hard Rules

- Do not treat child bead completion as proof that the epic is complete.
- Do not suppress `P1` issues to preserve momentum.
- Create explicit follow-up beads for meaningful `P2` work instead of burying it in prose.
