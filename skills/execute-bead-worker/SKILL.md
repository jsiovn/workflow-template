# Execute Bead Worker

Implement one assigned bead inside a swarm run.

## Goal

Deliver one bead safely inside the boundaries set by `swarm-epic`.

## Steps

1. Confirm the assignment from the coordinator:
   - epic id
   - bead id
   - `Read:` targets
   - `Inputs:` persisted prerequisites
   - `Files:` scope
   - `Verify:` commands or checks
   - reservation or conflict instructions
2. Read the bead details and inspect the required `Read:` targets plus the relevant code.
3. If the bead is underspecified or missing `Read:`, `Inputs:`, `Files:`, or `Verify:`, stop and return it to the coordinator instead of guessing.
4. Treat this worker as a fresh context. Do not assume access to prior epic discussion beyond the persisted bead contract, local repo state, and Agent Mail messages.
5. Register the worker and inspect its inbox:
   - Windows:
     ```powershell
     .\scripts\windows\agent-mail.ps1 --repo . register --name worker/<bead-id> --role worker --epic-id <epic-id> --bead-id <bead-id>
     .\scripts\windows\agent-mail.ps1 --repo . inbox --recipient worker/<bead-id>
     ```
   - POSIX:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/posix/agent-mail.sh --repo . register --name worker/<bead-id> --role worker --epic-id <epic-id> --bead-id <bead-id>
     ./scripts/posix/agent-mail.sh --repo . inbox --recipient worker/<bead-id>
     ```
6. Reserve the declared file scope before editing through the shared control plane:
   - Windows:
     ```powershell
     .\scripts\windows\agent-mail.ps1 --repo . reserve --owner worker/<bead-id> --epic-id <epic-id> --bead-id <bead-id> --path <path1> --path <path2>
     ```
   - POSIX:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/posix/agent-mail.sh --repo . reserve --owner worker/<bead-id> --epic-id <epic-id> --bead-id <bead-id> --path <path1> --path <path2>
     ```
   If reservation fails, stop and report the conflict to the coordinator.
7. Update `.beads/workflow/HANDOFF.json` for this worker context:
   - `role`
   - `epic_id`
   - `bead_id`
   - `summary`
   - `next_action`
8. Post a `started` message to `bead/<bead-id>` so the coordinator and other sessions can see who owns the bead.
   - Windows:
     ```powershell
     .\scripts\windows\agent-mail.ps1 --repo . post --thread bead/<bead-id> --sender worker/<bead-id> --type started --body '{"status":"started"}' --epic-id <epic-id> --bead-id <bead-id>
     ```
   - POSIX:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/posix/agent-mail.sh --repo . post --thread bead/<bead-id> --sender worker/<bead-id> --type started --body '{"status":"started"}' --epic-id <epic-id> --bead-id <bead-id>
     ```
9. Implement only within the assigned scope and only after confirming the required `Inputs:` are present in persisted form.
10. Run the assigned verification commands and any required repo-local `build-and-test` checks for the touched surface area.
11. Report back to the coordinator with:
   - changed files
   - `Inputs:` consumed
   - verification commands run
   - key output or exit status
   - any new risks or follow-up work
   - suggested closeout note covering what changed, where it was persisted, and what downstream beads can now rely on
   - confirmation that reservations were released
12. Release reservations and post either a `completed` or `blocked` message to `bead/<bead-id>`.
   - release syntax:
     - Windows: `.\scripts\windows\agent-mail.ps1 --repo . release-reservations --owner worker/<bead-id> --bead-id <bead-id>`
     - POSIX: `./scripts/posix/agent-mail.sh --repo . release-reservations --owner worker/<bead-id> --bead-id <bead-id>`
13. If blocked or context-limited:
   - update `HANDOFF.json`
   - release reservations if possible
   - report the blocker clearly to the coordinator
   - classify the blocker as exactly one of:
     - `clarify` - small missing fact or instruction; the current worker context is still useful
     - `env` - environment, runtime, credential, or reservation problem; the current worker context is still useful once the environment is fixed
     - `contract` - the bead contract is incomplete, wrong, or missing required persisted inputs; the coordinator should tighten the bead before retry
     - `scope` - the bead needs splitting, replanning, or a changed file boundary; the coordinator should not keep this worker running as-is
   - include `Context reusable: yes` for `clarify` or `env`, and `Context reusable: no` for `contract` or `scope`

## Hard Rules

- Do not run `bd update`, `bd close`, or any other bead status mutation.
- Do not expand the file scope without coordinator approval.
- Do not silently skip verification.
- Do not keep reservations after you stop working.
- Do not assume another session can see local `.beads/workflow/`; shared coordination only happens through Agent Mail.
- Do not continue if the bead still depends on prior chat memory instead of persisted inputs.
- If blocked, prefer a crisp blocker report over speculative fixes. The coordinator decides whether this worker should continue or be replaced.
