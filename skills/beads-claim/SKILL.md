# Beads Claim

**Workflow position:** Manual executor session, step 1 of 7. Next: `writing-plans`. See `BEADS_WORKFLOW.md`.

Find a ready bead and claim it for this session.

<HARD-GATE>
This is a manual executor skill. It must not be invoked in a planner session or inside `execute-bead-worker`.

Only invoke this skill when:

- the user wants to start manual implementation
- the session is a manual executor session

Do not invoke this skill when:

- beads were just created in this session
- you are in the middle of `brainstorming` or `beads-planner`
- `swarm-epic` already assigned the bead to a worker
</HARD-GATE>

## Steps

1. If the current repo is not initialized for Beads, stop and tell the user to run the template bootstrap script or at minimum `bd init --prefix <prefix>` plus the repo scaffolding steps.
2. Find ready work:
   ```bash
   bd ready --json
   ```
3. Select a bead. If the user specified one, use that. Otherwise, choose the best ready bead based on current context, priority, and dependencies.
4. Show the bead details before claiming:
   ```bash
   bd show <id> --json
   ```
5. Confirm or auto-claim:
   - present the bead title and description first
   - if this skill was invoked by `executor-once`, `executor-loop`, or `executor-loop-epic` and the bead choice is unambiguous, proceed without an extra confirmation turn
   - if the choice is ambiguous, ask the user before claiming
6. Claim it:
   ```bash
   bd update <id> --status in_progress
   ```
7. Report the claimed bead id and title, then proceed to `writing-plans` for the execution plan.

## Rules

- Only claim one bead per manual executor session.
- If no beads are ready, report that and suggest running a planner session first.
- If the user already specified a bead id, skip the selection step but still show details before claiming.
- When `executor-once`, `executor-loop`, or `executor-loop-epic` is driving the flow, it is valid to claim without confirmation when bead choice is unambiguous.
- Do not start coding before claiming. The bead must be `in_progress` before any implementation.
- `swarm-epic` owns claiming and closing for swarm runs. Workers do not call this skill.
