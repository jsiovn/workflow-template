# Writing Plans

**Workflow position:** Executor session, step 2 of 7 (after claiming bead). Next: implement -> `build-and-test` -> `verification-before-completion` or `requesting-code-review` -> `beads-close`. See BEADS_WORKFLOW.md.

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they do not know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

<HARD-GATE>
This is an **executor skill**. It should only be invoked in a session where a bead has been claimed via `bd update <id> --status in_progress`. Do NOT invoke this in a planner session that just ran `brainstorming`, `planner-research`, or `beads-planner`.
</HARD-GATE>

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- In downstream repos using the workflow backup mirror, `docs/plans/` stays local-only in the project repo and is mirrored later by `sync-workflow-backup`
- (User preferences for plan location override this default)

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, it should have been broken into sub-project specs during brainstorming. If it was not, suggest breaking this into separate plans - one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns.

This structure informs the task decomposition. Each task should produce self-contained changes that make sense independently.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** Use Codex subagents when appropriate to implement this plan. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## Verification Section (REQUIRED)

Every plan MUST end with a `## Verification` section that defines how to test the changes against the live system. This section is what `build-and-test` will execute after implementation.

Include:
- **What to build** - which components need rebuilding
- **How to deploy** - exact deploy commands
- **What to test** - specific API calls, expected responses, or observable behaviors
- **Success criteria** - what output or behavior means "it works"
- **Working directory and prerequisites** - when commands must run from a specific directory, need env vars, require a device, container, browser, fixture data, or seeded state

The verification section must be executable without guesswork. Assume the repo is still using the generic stage-1 `build-and-test` skill unless a repo-specific specialization already exists.

That means:
- write exact shell commands, not summaries
- prefer repo-owned wrapper commands when platform differences matter, such as local Windows with remote POSIX or Windows SSH execution
- include URLs, ports, endpoints, paths, and process names when relevant
- name the expected output, status code, DOM text, screenshot cue, or log line
- say when manual browser inspection is required and what to look for
- state whether a missing optional dependency such as a live device should fail the bead or downgrade the check to a skipped optional smoke test

Example:
````markdown
## Verification

**Build:** `cd native-lib && bash build.sh x64`
**Deploy:** `python inject.py --device emulator-5564 --launch`
**Smoke test:** `curl http://localhost:32164/ping` -> `{"status": "ok"}`

**Functional tests:**
1. Start campaign: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/campaign/start -d 'stage=1'` -> 200
2. Check state: `curl http://localhost:8787/status` -> expected state payload
3. Observe: bot performs the expected in-game behavior

**Success criteria:** All functional tests pass, no crashes in `adb logcat -s tgunmod:V`
````

Without this section, `build-and-test` will not know what to verify. Make it specific to the bead.

### Harness-first rule for in-game actions

If the repo has `.harness/actions.yaml` (profile=game-re), the plan's `## Verification` MUST express in-game actions as `python scripts/shared/harness.py trigger <action> --json` calls. **You are the one running verification, not the user.** Writing "user runs the game and clicks X" when a catalogued action covers the same trigger is a defect.

Run `python scripts/shared/harness.py list` before writing the verification section to see what is already catalogued. If the action you need is not catalogued:

- if cataloguing it is in scope (small, no new game-specific knowledge needed beyond what the bead already assumes), include a step to add it to `.harness/actions.yaml`
- otherwise, create a follow-up bead to catalogue it and mark the current bead as soft-blocked on that follow-up

Only ask the user to perform a manual in-game step when the harness genuinely cannot reach the scenario (e.g., the game process is not running and only the user can launch it). Even then, state it once and capture the action for future use.

If the repo uses an SSH-backed runtime target, keep the verification commands stable across backends by pointing at repo-owned wrapper scripts instead of embedding brittle OS-specific shell logic in the plan.

If you notice the same verification sequence repeating across multiple beads, that is a signal to specialize the repo-local `build-and-test` skill as stage 2 work.

## Remember

- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Plan Review Loop

After completing each chunk of the plan:

1. Dispatch a plan-document-reviewer subagent (see `plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md`) with precisely crafted review context - never your session history.
   - Provide: chunk content, path to spec document
2. If issues are found:
   - Fix the issues in the chunk
   - Re-dispatch reviewer for that chunk
   - Repeat until approved
3. If approved: proceed to next chunk (or execution handoff if last chunk)

**Chunk boundaries:** Use `## Chunk N: <name>` headings to delimit chunks. Each chunk should be <=1000 lines and logically self-contained.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Ready to execute?"**

- If this skill was invoked by `/executor-loop`, `/executor-loop-epic`, or `/executor-once`, proceed to implementation automatically â€” do not wait for confirmation.
- Otherwise, wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

**When proceeding:** Use Codex subagents when they help, with code review (`requesting-code-review`) after each major task.

**After implementation is complete:** Invoke `build-and-test` (read `.codex/skills/build-and-test/SKILL.md` and follow it). The skill executes the verification contract from the plan and may be generic or repo-specific depending on the repo's maturity. If `build-and-test` fails, fix the implementation or tighten the plan and re-run it before moving to verification. Do NOT skip this step.
