# Prune Local Branches

Remove local branches whose remote-tracking upstream is gone — the PR merged and origin deleted the branch — and tear down any sibling worktree still attached to them. A branch that is checked out in a worktree **cannot** be deleted (`git branch -D` refuses it: `cannot delete branch '<n>' used by worktree at '<path>'`), so this skill removes the worktree **first**, then deletes the branch.

This is the **bulk** counterpart to `cleanup-worktree` (which removes one worktree at a time and is PR-state-aware). See [Integration with cleanup-worktree](#integration-with-cleanup-worktree) — the two share one safety seam and must stay aligned.

## Steps

### 0. Refuse to run in a bare repository

```bash
git rev-parse --is-bare-repository    # must print "false"
```

If this prints `true`, stop and tell the user to run from a normal checkout. A bare repo has no working tree, no current-worktree to protect, and the detection below does not apply.

### 1. Fetch and prune remote-tracking refs

```bash
git fetch --prune
```

Updates remote-tracking refs and drops any that no longer exist on origin — this is what makes a branch's upstream show up as gone.

### 2. Prune stale worktree admin entries

```bash
git worktree prune
```

Drops the registration for any worktree whose directory was already deleted by hand. This **must** run before any branch deletion: while a stale admin entry survives, `git branch -D` still refuses the branch with `used by worktree`. (`git worktree prune` only touches already-missing directories — it never deletes a live or locked worktree.)

### 3. Find branches with a gone upstream — and their worktrees — via plumbing

**Do not** use `git branch -vv | grep ': gone]'`. That grep false-matches a branch whose upstream is *live* but whose commit subject merely contains the text `[upstream: gone]`, and the `* `/`+ ` prefixes on the current/worktree-checked-out rows shift the fields. Read the tracking field directly instead:

```bash
git for-each-ref \
  --format='%(refname:short)%09%(upstream:track)%09%(worktreepath)%09%(objectname:short)%09%(contents:subject)' \
  refs/heads
```

Keep only rows whose **second** (TAB-separated) field is exactly `[gone]`. The TAB-separated fields are: `branch <TAB> track <TAB> worktreepath (may be empty) <TAB> tipSHA <TAB> subject`. Refnames cannot contain TAB or spaces, so this parse is robust, and `%(worktreepath)` gives you the attached worktree path in the same pass — no separate branch→path lookup needed.

A quick gone-only filter:

```bash
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)%09%(upstream:track)%09%(worktreepath)' refs/heads \
  | awk -F'\t' '$2 == "[gone]"'
```

If no rows remain, report **"No stale local branches found"** and stop.

### 4. Identify the worktrees you must never remove

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel    # the current worktree's root
git worktree list --porcelain    # first block = the main working tree; `locked` lines mark locked worktrees
```

- The **first** block of `git worktree list --porcelain` is always the **main working tree** — never a removal target.
- The worktree whose root equals `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` is the **current** one — never a removal target (skip it and continue; do not abort the whole sweep).
- **Canonicalize before comparing.** Resolve each candidate worktree path *and* the main/current paths through `realpath` (or `git -C <path> rev-parse --show-toplevel`) and compare the canonical strings — raw paths differ across symlinks, trailing slashes, and add-time-vs-resolved forms. If a path cannot be canonicalized or the match is uncertain, **refuse** to remove that worktree.

### 5. Classify each gone branch that has a worktree

For every gone branch whose `worktreepath` (from step 3) is non-empty, inspect that worktree from the main repo:

```bash
git -C <path> status --porcelain              # non-empty => DIRTY (uncommitted/untracked real work)
git -C <path> status --porcelain --ignored    # any `!!` row (e.g. .env*, *.db, .beads/) => local-only files removal will delete
```

- **Dirty** = `git status --porcelain` is non-empty (modified, staged, or genuinely-untracked files — real unsaved work; git-ignored build artifacts do not show here).
- **Locked** = the worktree's block in `git worktree list --porcelain` contains a `locked` line.
- **Local-only files** = `!!` rows from `--ignored` — these are deleted by `git worktree remove` even without `--force`, and their loss is unrecoverable because they were never in git. (`.env*` is usually a copy seeded from the main tree, so its loss is harmless; `*.db` / `.beads/interactions.jsonl` may be unique worktree state.)
- If `git -C <path> status` **errors** (permission denied, foreign filesystem, missing dir), treat the worktree as **UNKNOWN** → skip and report. Never read an error as "clean".

### 6. Confirm, then prune each branch

Show the user a table and require explicit approval before deleting anything:

| branch | worktree | dirty | locked | local-only files | tip (sha — subject) |
| ------ | -------- | ----- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |

- The **default-selected** set is branches whose worktree is **clean + unlocked** (or that have no worktree). **Default-skip** every dirty, locked, or status-unknown worktree — route those to `cleanup-worktree` (per-worktree, PR-aware) or have the user handle them, rather than force-removing here.
- The tip `sha — subject` column is the only window into un-landed work (the `@{u}..HEAD` unpushed check is structurally impossible once the upstream is gone). Surface it so the user can spot a branch that carries commits added after its last push.

Then iterate over the **confirmed** branches, `continue`-ing on every skip:

For each confirmed gone branch:

1. If it is the **current branch**, or its worktree is the **current** or **main** worktree → skip (report the reason), continue.
2. If it has a worktree:
   - **clean + unlocked** → `git worktree remove <path>`
   - **dirty / has local-only files**, and only with explicit **per-item** confirmation → `git worktree remove --force <path>`
   - **locked**, and only with explicit **per-item** confirmation → `git worktree unlock <path> && git worktree remove <path>` (a single `--force` does **not** remove a locked worktree — it fails with `use 'remove -f -f' to override or unlock first`)
   - If the removal exits **non-zero**, skip (report) and continue — **do not** fall through to delete the branch.
3. `git branch -D <branch>` — only after the worktree was removed (exit 0) or the branch had no worktree. The tip SHA from step 3 is the recovery handle.

Never treat one "yes, force" as a batch-wide flag — confirm each forced/locked removal by its exact path.

### 7. Report

```bash
git worktree prune
git worktree list
```

List, with no embellishment:

- every branch deleted, each with its **tip SHA** — note it is recoverable via `git branch <name> <sha>` until git's next gc;
- every worktree removed;
- everything skipped, with the reason (dirty, locked, current/main worktree, status-unknown, removal failed).

Describe the deleted branches as **"upstream gone (remote branch deleted on origin — normally merged)"**. Never assert "merged": a deleted remote head is not proof of a merge.

## Hard Rules

- **Detect gone branches only via** `git for-each-ref … %(upstream:track)` matched exactly to `[gone]` — never `git branch -vv | grep ': gone]'`. A commit subject can contain that literal text and false-match a branch with a **live** upstream.
- **Abort in a bare repository** (`git rev-parse --is-bare-repository` is `true`).
- **Never remove the main working tree or the current worktree.** Canonicalize both sides before comparing; the first `git worktree list --porcelain` block is main; refuse removal when the match is uncertain.
- **Remove a branch's worktree before `git branch -D`.** Run `git branch -D` only after the worktree was removed with exit 0, or when the branch has no worktree. On any skip or failed removal, `continue` — never fall through to delete.
- **Default-skip every dirty, locked, or status-unknown worktree.** Remove one only after **per-item** confirmation that names the exact path and shows its `git status --porcelain` — never as a batch-wide `--force`.
- **A single `--force` cannot remove a locked worktree** — `git worktree unlock <path>` first (or `git worktree remove --force --force <path>`), and only with explicit confirmation. Single `--force` is for the dirty/untracked case only.
- **Worktree removal deletes git-ignored local-only files** (`.env*`, `*.db`, `.beads/interactions.jsonl` seeded into executor worktrees) even without `--force` — surface them from `--ignored` and confirm before removing; that loss is unrecoverable.
- **Use `git branch -D`, not `-d`.** `: gone]` branches are post-merge, and squash/rebase merges make `-d` falsely refuse them. Print each deleted branch's tip SHA so the work is recoverable before gc. (Deliberate divergence from `cleanup-worktree` — see below.)
- **Never run a `gh pr list` check here.** An open PR keeps its remote head alive, so the branch never shows `[gone]` and is never a target; gh would be redundant and cannot tell a merged branch from a manually-deleted one.
- **Never delete the remote branch.**

## Integration with cleanup-worktree

`prune-local-branches` (this skill) and `cleanup-worktree` share one safety seam — keep them aligned if either changes.

- **Division of labor.** `cleanup-worktree` = single, PR-aware teardown of **one** in-flight worktree whose upstream may still be live; use it while a branch is under review (it runs `gh pr list` and the `@{u}..HEAD` unpushed-commit gate). `prune-local-branches` = **bulk** sweep of branches already `[gone]` (remote head deleted, normally post-merge) — after-the-fact housekeeping. They never overlap: an open PR keeps its head alive, so such a branch never shows `[gone]`.
- **Shared safety seam.** Never remove the main working tree or the current worktree; default-skip dirty/locked worktrees; never pass `--force` to `git worktree remove` without explicit per-item confirmation; never delete the remote branch. Both rely on "main is the first porcelain block" — parse `git worktree list --porcelain` and mirror that wording.
- **Three deliberate divergences** (documented so the two skills read as one seam, not drift):
  1. **Unconditional `git branch -D`** — `cleanup-worktree` prefers `-d` first because its target may be unmerged; here `[gone]` branches are post-merge and `-d` falsely refuses squash/rebase merges.
  2. **No `@{u}..HEAD` unpushed-commit gate** — structurally impossible: the upstream is already gone, so `@{u}` no longer resolves. The `[gone]` filter excludes never-pushed branches (they have no upstream); the tip-SHA column in the step 6 table is the compensating control for post-push local commits.
  3. **Skip-and-continue on the current worktree** instead of `cleanup-worktree`'s hard refuse-to-run-from-inside — by design, so one bad cwd does not abort a bulk sweep. Report it: "Skipped `<branch>` — its worktree is the current directory; re-run from the main repo to drop it too."
- **Route hard cases over the seam.** Dirty, locked, or open-PR worktrees belong to `cleanup-worktree` (per-worktree, PR-aware) or manual handling — keep this skill to the clean, fully-landed cases. Submodule-bearing or locked-missing-dir worktrees: report as "skipped — handle manually".
