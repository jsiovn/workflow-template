# Executor Epic Task Worktree

Run exactly one full executor cycle for one bead, isolated in a fresh git worktree cut from the latest epic branch (`epic/<epic-bead-id>`), and deliver it as a PR that targets that epic branch.

This is the preferred path when an epic has its own long-lived integration branch (so the epic can land in main as one merge), each child bead should ship as its own PR into that epic branch, **and** the main working tree has in-flight changes that must not be touched. No WIP commit, no branch switch in the main tree — all bead work happens in a sibling worktree that is created automatically and left in place after the PR opens, so the user can return to it for review comments, screenshots, or CI fixes. Removal is a separate manual step via the `cleanup-worktree` skill.

## Steps

1. If the current repo is not initialized for Beads, stop and tell the user to run the template bootstrap script or at minimum `bd init --prefix <prefix>` plus the repo scaffolding steps.

2. Determine the target bead **before touching anything**:
   - if the user supplied a bead id in the current request, use that bead
   - if the user supplied freeform selector text, treat it as a selector or hint
   - otherwise inspect `bd ready --json` and choose the best ready bead autonomously
   - preference order: a ready bead clearly related to the current repo context or recent planner discussion, else the highest-priority ready bead
   - if the choice is ambiguous, ask before proceeding
   - record the chosen bead id as `<BEAD_ID>` (e.g. `lexify-wyk`) for the rest of the flow

3. Determine the **parent epic bead** for `<BEAD_ID>`:
   - if the user supplied an epic id in the current request, use that epic
   - otherwise inspect the bead's dependencies (`bd show <BEAD_ID> --json` and/or `bd dep list <BEAD_ID>`) and look for a parent dep whose target bead has `--type epic`
   - if multiple epic parents exist, ask the user which one to target
   - if no epic parent exists, stop and tell the user this skill requires the bead to be parented under an epic (or have them pass the epic id explicitly)
   - record the epic bead id as `<EPIC_BEAD_ID>`

4. Record `<EPIC_BRANCH>` as `epic/<EPIC_BEAD_ID>` — no slug. Using just the bead id prevents duplicate branches when different sessions derive different slugs from the same epic title.

5. Derive `<TASK_SLUG>` from the bead title and record `<BRANCH_NAME>` as `feat/<BEAD_ID>-<TASK_SLUG>`:
   - lowercase the title
   - drop file extensions (`.tsx`, `.ts`, `.py`, etc.) and leading punctuation around tokens (`__root.tsx` → `root`)
   - replace any non-alphanumeric run with a single `-`
   - drop English filler words: `the`, `a`, `an`, `and`, `or`, `of`, `to`, `for`, `in`, `on`, `with`, `vs`, `via`, plus low-signal trailing words like `cleanup`, `update`, `changes`, `work`
   - **preserve** task identifier prefixes the title carries (e.g. `t9`, `m3`, `phase2`)
   - keep at most 4–5 meaningful tokens, joined with `-`
   - trim leading/trailing `-`, collapse repeated `-`
   - target ≤ 40 characters for the slug itself; truncate the last token if needed
   - example: bead `lexify-wyk` titled `T9 — __root.tsx wiring + Home/LoggedOut swap + cleanup` → `<TASK_SLUG>` is `t9-root-wiring-swap` and `<BRANCH_NAME>` is `feat/lexify-wyk-t9-root-wiring-swap`
   - if the title is too generic to yield ≥ 2 meaningful tokens (e.g. `Fix bug`), fall back to `<BRANCH_NAME>` = `feat/<BEAD_ID>` and note this in the final summary

6. **Do not touch the main working tree at all.** No dirty-state check, no WIP commit, no branch switch. The main tree must remain on whatever branch it is currently on.

7. Resolve the epic branch. Try in this order:
   - `git rev-parse --verify <EPIC_BRANCH>` (local)
   - `git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin <EPIC_BRANCH>` (remote)
   - record whether the epic branch exists locally, only remotely, or not at all
   - if it exists nowhere, this skill will create it from the latest default branch in step 9. Detect the default branch first: use `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` if present; otherwise fall back to `main` if it exists, else `master`. Record as `<DEFAULT_BRANCH>`. Note in the final summary that the epic branch was created.

8. Determine the worktree path. Always use just the bead id as the path suffix (no task slug) so paths stay short and predictable:
   ```
   REPO_NAME=$(basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))
   WORKTREE_PATH="../${REPO_NAME}-feat-${BEAD_ID}"
   ```

9. Make sure the epic branch exists on `origin` so the worktree can be cut from it cleanly. Use whichever path matches step 7:
   - **exists on origin**:
     ```
     git fetch origin <EPIC_BRANCH>
     ```
   - **exists only locally**: push it so the worktree can branch from `origin/<EPIC_BRANCH>` (do not move the local ref):
     ```
     git push -u origin <EPIC_BRANCH>:<EPIC_BRANCH>
     git fetch origin <EPIC_BRANCH>
     ```
   - **does not exist anywhere**: create it from the latest default branch without disturbing the main tree, then push it. Use a temporary worktree-free branch creation via `git branch` (which does not touch the working tree):
     ```
     git fetch origin <DEFAULT_BRANCH>
     git branch <EPIC_BRANCH> origin/<DEFAULT_BRANCH>
     git push -u origin <EPIC_BRANCH>
     git fetch origin <EPIC_BRANCH>
     ```

10. Create the worktree on a new branch off the freshly fetched epic branch:
    ```
    git worktree add <WORKTREE_PATH> -b <BRANCH_NAME> origin/<EPIC_BRANCH>
    ```
    - If `<BRANCH_NAME>` already exists locally, stop and ask the user whether to reuse, rename, or delete it.
    - If `<WORKTREE_PATH>` already exists on disk, stop and ask the user.

11. Run the executor cycle for `<BEAD_ID>` — **every step in order, operating inside `<WORKTREE_PATH>`**:
    - `beads-claim`
    - `writing-plans`
    - implementation
    - `systematic-debugging` if blocked
    - **`build-and-test`** — REQUIRED after implementation. Read the repo-local skill from the worktree (`.claude/skills/build-and-test/SKILL.md` for Claude sessions; `.codex/skills/build-and-test/SKILL.md` when running under Codex) and follow it. Do NOT skip this step.
    - `verification-before-completion` (run the verification commands)
    - `requesting-code-review` (dispatch the code-reviewer subagent; required, not optional)
    - `beads-close`

12. If separate work is discovered, create follow-up beads during execution or before close. Keep this worktree scoped to `<BEAD_ID>` only.

13. If a blocker appears, update the current bead, summarize the blocker, and stop. Report the worktree path so the user can return to it. The worktree is never removed automatically — use the `cleanup-worktree` skill when ready to discard it.

14. If build/test fails and the fix is still in scope, return to implementation and retry.

15. After successful close, finalize the branch from within `<WORKTREE_PATH>` following the **`finishing-a-development-branch`** skill:
    - verify clean tree and commits ahead of `<EPIC_BRANCH>` (not main)
    - `git push -u origin HEAD`
    - `gh pr create --base <EPIC_BRANCH> --title "<conventional-commit title>" --body "..."` — the PR body must include both an `Epic: <EPIC_BEAD_ID>` line and a `Bead: <BEAD_ID>` reference line (e.g. `Bead: lexify-a8m`). The title follows conventional commits format (`type(scope): description`) with no bead id prefix.
    - report the PR URL

16. Stop with a concise summary: bead id, epic id, `<EPIC_BRANCH>` (PR base), `<BRANCH_NAME>`, PR URL, and the worktree path (so the user can `cd` back in for follow-up work). The main working tree was never touched. Note if the epic branch was created by this run. The worktree is left in place — use the `cleanup-worktree` skill to remove it once review comments, screenshots, and CI fixes are done.

## Checkout Discipline

- Never touch or inspect the main working tree during execution.
- If `bd where` fails inside the worktree, stop and repair with `bd bootstrap --yes` from within the worktree before continuing.
- Never rebase or force-push the epic branch or the default branch.
- If the epic branch (`epic/<EPIC_BEAD_ID>`) does not exist locally or on origin, create it from the latest default branch with `git branch` (no checkout, so the main tree stays put) and push it before cutting the worktree off `origin/<EPIC_BRANCH>`.
- The feature branch must be named `feat/<BEAD_ID>-<TASK_SLUG>` so it is unambiguously tied to the bead and human-readable. Fall back to `feat/<BEAD_ID>` only when the title yields fewer than 2 meaningful tokens.
- The worktree directory name must be `../<repo>-feat-<BEAD_ID>` (no task slug suffix) so a `git worktree list` makes the active bead obvious without the path getting unwieldy.

## Hard Rules

- One bead, one worktree, one PR — and the PR targets the epic branch, not the default branch.
- Never touch the main working tree.
- Do not silently skip verification or code review.
- Do not continue into another bead after the PR is opened.
- If `gh` is unavailable, push the branch and report the branch name plus the intended `--base <EPIC_BRANCH>` for manual PR creation rather than failing the whole flow.
- Never remove the worktree automatically — it stays in place after success or blocker so the user can address PR comments, capture screenshots, or fix CI. Removal is a deliberate user action via the `cleanup-worktree` skill.
- **No pausing between sub-skill invocations.** After each sub-skill (`beads-claim`, `writing-plans`, `build-and-test`, `verification-before-completion`, `requesting-code-review`, `beads-close`) completes, invoke the next one immediately without asking the user for confirmation. Only stop mid-flow for a genuine blocker (build failure, merge conflict, ambiguous bead choice).
