# Executor Loop Epic

Run repeated manual executor cycles bead-by-bead, but only within one epic.

Compatibility path only. For coordinator-plus-worker execution with reservations, runtime state, and handoff files, prefer `swarm-epic`. For manual execution, prefer fresh `executor-once` sessions per bead over long-lived epic loops.

## Steps

1. If the current repo is not initialized for Beads, stop and tell the user to run the template bootstrap script or at minimum `bd init --prefix <prefix>` plus the repo scaffolding steps.
2. Determine the target epic:
   - if the user supplied an epic id in the current request, use that epic
   - otherwise ask for the epic id or enough selector text to identify one unambiguously
3. Verify the epic exists and inspect it:
   ```bash
   bd show <epic-id> --json
   ```
4. Create a feature branch for this epic:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b epic/<epic-id>
   ```
   If the branch already exists, check it out instead:
   ```bash
   git checkout epic/<epic-id>
   ```
5. Find ready work only within that epic's descendant tree:
   ```bash
   bd ready --parent <epic-id> --json
   ```
6. Choose the next ready descendant bead using this preference order:
   - first, the ready descendant bead most clearly related to the current repo context or recent discussion
   - otherwise, the highest-priority ready descendant bead
7. Run one full manual executor cycle for that bead by invoking every step in order:
   - `beads-claim`
   - `writing-plans`
   - implementation
   - `systematic-debugging` if blocked
   - `build-and-test` after implementation; read `.codex/skills/build-and-test/SKILL.md` and follow it
   - `verification-before-completion` or `requesting-code-review`
   - `beads-close`
8. After a successful close and local commit, inspect the epic again for more ready descendants:
   ```bash
   bd ready --parent <epic-id> --json
   ```
9. Repeat until one of these stop conditions is reached:
   - no ready descendant beads remain under the epic
   - descendant work exists under the epic, but none of it is ready
   - a blocker requires user input
   - build, test, or verification cannot pass
   - manual intervention is required
10. When separate follow-up work is discovered during execution:
    - create the follow-up bead
    - parent it to the same epic by default unless the discovery clearly belongs elsewhere
    - preserve any dependency links needed to explain the relationship
11. When the epic has no ready descendants left:
    - run `build-and-test` one final time to verify the full epic
    - invoke `review-epic` if the user wants an epic-level quality gate before the PR
    - use `finishing-a-development-branch` to push the feature branch and create a PR targeting `main`
12. When stopping early:
    - summarize the current bead, the blocker, and what input or fix is needed

## Hard Rules

- Stay within the target epic. Do not wander to unrelated ready beads outside it.
- Treat each descendant bead as its own logical executor cycle.
- Do not hold multiple claimed beads at once.
- Never continue past a blocker without user input.
- If the supplied epic id is not actually an epic, stop and ask the user whether to scope to that parent bead anyway or choose a different epic.
- Never merge locally; the PR is the merge mechanism.
- This is a sequential compatibility path, not the primary swarm workflow.
- If the session accumulates too much context, stop after the current bead and restart the next bead in a fresh session.
